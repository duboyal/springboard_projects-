      "Who knows.  We don't know what news they will release, and if so, will it be big news.  Most importantly, they SHOULD be on at least another exchange by then.  They should be on another exchange in 3M and cryptos should be recovered more from the recent downswing.  So I would say you should be able to count on a minimum of .20.  I'm just predicting a minimum price. It's seen .20 before, it should be able to do that again for sure.  Heck, invest now, and there's a great chance you'll double your money in 3M. Can't complain about that.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'd have to agree that $35 is impossible in the near term. Since there are 6 billion coins circulating, currently, it would take true mass adoption to get up to that price, and mass adoption isn't going to happen that quickly. Because in the near term, realistically, if the price started shooting up, there are too many whale holders that would dump loads of ETN on the exchange which would drop the price.  But over time, the whalers will liquidate and the buyers will grow in number.\n",
      "\n",
      "BUT....a mass population adoption might not be all that we'd be waiting on.  If ETN makes some big partnership deals with companies that have big pockets, those companies might purchase $$$$Millions worth of the ETN themselves to keep in reserves and to drive the value up. That could happen as well.  And they'll keep those reserves in a secured offline wallet that the Electroneum team maintains.\n",
      "During a similar post a few days ago, I mentioned the current Bear Market BTC and the alts are in. In my opinion, this latest bounce is another Bull trap. You still could have made significant money if you entered a large position at near .05 cents and sold into the recent .07 move. But The overall Markets are likely headed lower to the 5-6K range. We haven't seen true capitulation with massive volume, a double bottom, or violent bounces WITH FOLLOW THRU. ETN and LTC are actually two of the best performing coins in their resilience and bounce.  I have to say, \"WATCH THE BTC PRICE MOVEMENT.\" The TA calls for it so go lower. When I see BTC near 5500 - 6000 and Massive Capitulation I will enter very large positions. I wish everyone the best! \n",
      "I find it unfortunate that we only talk about price in terms of dollars as ETN could double in value if Bitcoin were to suddenly double in value. That's not how it should be, but that's how things mostly work right now. Hopefully these new exchanges launching soon with direct Fiat-to-crypto platforms might change that.\n",

      "Good article.  About the only thing that fiat banking systems have over cryptos is that you can't lose your money with a bank. With a crypto, if you have an offline wallet and lost your keys, or lost a wallet that wasn't backed up, then you've lost your cryptos forever.  If someone managed to steal your cryptos, you've lost them forever.  A bank can insure those things. If a bank gets robbed, your money is insured for up to $250K for example.  Also, the dollar is backed by a military to ensure it is used as currency.  Cryptos do not.  A new crypto can move into the neighborhood stealing the value from other cryptos.  You cannot launch a war with a military to prevent the other crypto from existing.  So in the crypto world, when someone goes to \"war\" to discredit another cryto, they go onto reddit threads and YouTube comment sections to make up lies and spread FUD about the coin they don't want around.  ETN is a great example of that.  \n",
