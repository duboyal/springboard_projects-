4,7d7sq8,post,,"All my Ethereum stolen right out of my wallet Just wanted to warn everyone and/or ask for help.  I had my Exodus wallet open and I walked away to take a shower.  When I had returned all of my ETH had been sent away without my permission.  I'm not sure what to do.  But be careful.  

The Transaction: https://etherscan.io/tx/0xe9d940eb31c490b98802ad368fa15d9c06b3336240b70b8e4ba1f303354a4956

The address that stole my Ether: 0xca2909f8c9e9f656eb468d53c84c23063e2dec4c

If anyone could help that would be greatly appreciated.  I know most likely my funds are gone forever but thought I should at least let others know. 

UPDATE:  All my BTC is gone now too.  Looks like I'm fucked.

UPDATE 2: First off, I'd like to thank everyone in this thread for both their kind words and advice.  I've responded to JP (Exodus Co-Founder) down in the thread but I'll copy and paste most of comment here. 

While it makes me feel like a dumbass, I did attempt to check MyBTGWallet as I was curious about BTG and wanted to know if there was any to claim etc. Initially, I went to https://bitcoingold.org and saw their address check box, after inputting my address, I seem to recall there being a link to https://mybtgwallet.com/ underneath the box. So, I clicked on it and was brought to the site, but as I was extremely hesitant to give out any of my information, I tried to assure myself it was legit. It displayed a valid SSL Certificate at the time of my visiting so I decided I would proceed. Unfortunately, this makes it pretty clear that it was all my fault. I'm embarrassed to say the least, and certainly heartbroken at my losses. I guess I'm a little new and didn't think much of it when I was asked for my seed, looking back that's pretty fucking stupid, there's no reason they my seed right? But the valid SSL had me fooled. I will surely never do something so stupid again and will take steps to increase security on my own. However, I do think BTG and MyBTGWallet should take some blame for this as they are not ensuring the security of their users/potential users but ultimately this is clearly my fault.

UPDATE 3: I've posted a new thread to thank you all for your help and to share my experience as well as some of the events that occurred following the hack. https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7dhhpy/all_my_ethereum_stolen_out_of_my_wallet_update_my/",1510813712.0

Sorry for not joining this earlier but first we wanted to make sure it’s not an issue on our side.

First, I am extremely sorry this happened, it’s gut-wrenching. Thank you for posting this, and thanks to the community for the upvotes. Security is extremely important, and it should be discussed.

I am not sure what happened in your case, but you are not the only one. Our support team just got four requests from users asking about how to reset their 12-words seed, and we have one case where we were able to reconstruct step-by-step what has happened.

In that case, the user tried to check his Bitcoin Gold balance on the site https://mybtgwallet.com/. The site now looks innocent, but it looked very different yesterday. It was asking users for their 12-word recovery seed, as seen here:
https://wayback.archive.org/web/20171114235844/http://mybtgwallet.com/ (credits to u/coelacan for discovering)

It’s an open source site, but you can see that the code is brand new, all the files have been uploaded to GitHub 20 hours ago: https://github.com/John-Dass/btcgpuwallet

We suspect this site has been hacked.

This Exodus user gave his 12-words seed to this site, and saw his funds stolen. First his ETH, then his BTC, just like in your case. Technically speaking, it happened at the same time, but the ETH balance is updated continuously, while the BTC balance needed a manual refresh.

This type of theft is ONLY possible if someone has access to your recovery seed.

Another user in this thread commented the same thing happened via the same phishing attack: https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7d7sq8/all_my_ethereum_stolen_right_out_of_my_wallet/dpw5fmx/

We have an in-app warning system we normally use to notify our users if a feature is not working as expected (e.g., if ShapeShift temporarily disables an exchange pair) or if the network is unreasonably slow (like the BTC network last weekend). We’ve just issued a warning about phishing sites asking for the recovery seed.

Again, I am terribly sorry about what happened. Please email us at support [AT] exodus.io if you’d like our team to help investigate your case personally.

Thanks,
JP

","I might have a good advice here on how to further protect un-authorised access to accounts.

Many sites implemented security in a form of an email confirmation login that needs to be clicked or code that needs to input to the site before logging user in.

STEP BY STEP.

1. User inputs login info and clicks LOG IN.

2. Email is sent to user email address with a CODE.

3. User enters that code into site that lets him fully log into site.


Should prevent access to hackers even if they obtain your log in information.

So if you are using the same password for things, this could be what happened.  See if you can find the link in your email if its there. Maybe you can see the last time that email was opened.

It's nothing to do with the operating system it's down to the user. Everyone though unix was impregnable until shellshock, then heartbleed, etc.

It's down to the user to not let people in. Yes, it is important to take precautions, but Windows is not any less safe than Unix. Just ensure that your keys are safe, make sure you protect your passwords, use 2fa on everything that you can and save your passwords. People will safe saving your password is unsafe, but if you got onto a phishing site the login credentials will not auto-fill if it's the wrong site. I personally use lastpass with 2fa and don't actually know my passwords (I keep a copy in an encrypted cold storage), so if I visit a phishing site I can't login. I also run my own mail servers with fully set-up verification (strict SPF+DMARC) to prevent spoofing, etc. I also have my 2fa on a phone which isn't my main phone that has no apps on it, etc.

>TommLeeJonesSkepticallyPeeringOverANewspaper.jpg","User error is not exactly an uncommon concept. 

You'd be amazed at the things people can achieve with social engineering alone. The biggest security threat in any situation you care to name are the people.

Also, look at this address: https://etherscan.io/address/0xca2909f8c9e9f656eb468d53c84c23063e2dec4c

Looking at the list of transfers, you can see the money was moved in by ""fake phishing"" and moved out by ""fake phishing"". Phishing is exactly what JP is describing - a tactic where people voluntarily give away their password or access. 

The reason the transfers happened within a short period of time, also, support this idea. The phisher collected as many sets of credentials as he/she dared, then executed the theft in one fell swoop, and then moved the money away. That money will now (most likely) be put into a truly untraceable type of crypto like Monero and it will never be seen by its real owners again. 

It seems overwhelmingly likely to me that the people who lost their money somehow gave away their credentials, most likely again through the site referenced during the time it was used to phish.

How stupid can you be?!?","Hello, stupid here, I transferred ETH into my emptied hacked rekt account because the exchange I'm trading on (simpleFX) will not let me withdraw to addresses that is not the largest depositing wallet. After getting hacked I became extremely nervous about my funds and security in general so I'm moving them around in some type of last attempt hope. Got em out and shapeshifted into LTC, now in a fresh wallet. Hacker never touched my DASH, Decred, Litecoin, just the ETH, have 1 token, COBINHOOD and was untouched. I'm thinking hacker took ETH and BTC due to ease to tumbling. Only lost .31 ETH due to the hack and didn't have BTC in the wallet so I guess I didn't lose much. Didn't wanna lose more considering IDK what the hack was where it originated from and how badly I was affected. I learned my lesson I guess.

Looking at the list of transfers, you can see the money was moved in by ""fake phishing"" and moved out by ""fake phishing"". Phishing is exactly what JP is describing - a tactic where people voluntarily give away their password or access. 

The reason the transfers happened within a short period of time, also, support this idea. The phisher collected as many sets of credentials as he/she dared, then executed the theft in one fell swoop, and then moved the money away. That money will now (most likely) be put into a truly untraceable type of crypto like Monero and it will never be seen by its real owners again. 

It seems overwhelmingly likely to me that the people who lost their money somehow gave away their credentials, most likely again through the site referenced during the time it was used to phish.

Also, look at this address: https://etherscan.io/address/0xca2909f8c9e9f656eb468d53c84c23063e2dec4c

Looking at the list of transfers, you can see the money was moved in by ""fake phishing"" and moved out by ""fake phishing"". Phishing is exactly what JP is describing - a tactic where people voluntarily give away their password or access. 

The reason the transfers happened within a short period of time, also, support this idea. The phisher collected as many sets of credentials as he/she dared, then executed the theft in one fell swoop, and then moved the money away. That money will now (most likely) be put into a truly untraceable type of crypto like Monero and it will never be seen by its real owners again. 

It seems overwhelmingly likely to me that the people who lost their money somehow gave away their credentials, most likely again through the site referenced during the time it was used to phish.

Personally, I'm also putting my money where my mouth is; i'm still using Edoxus. And still have my funds.","To be fair, mybtgwallet was officially endorsed by BTG's website *and* Twitter; that's more akin to institutional fraud than user error.",1510883390.0

Would it matter?  There could be 50,000 unique pieces of malware designed for Windows and only 1,000 for Mac. This would have almost zero impact on the effected demographic since only a fraction of these would amount to any significant damage.  It only takes 1 good exploit to matter, and I've already analyzed numerous that have effected people using Macs.

As discussed in [our previous blog post](https://medium.com/metamask/metamask-security-advisory-and-bug-bounty-for-seed-phrase-concern-bbd95ab63210), the metamask team has currently issued our first bug bounty, currently worth a total of 4.1 ether across multiple bounty platforms, and growing gradually as we add to it.

The bounty will be awarded to anyone who can reproduce a behavior where a MetaMask user is shown a seed phrase that later cannot restore the accounts they are initially given to use with MetaMask.

Finding this bug could either be done with manual reproduction steps, or code analysis, and either would be easier with some context, and so this AMA is for anyone interested in pursuing this bounty to ask any questions they want about the architecture of our account and seed phrase management.

Some discussion has already taken place on [the official bounty github issue](https://github.com/MetaMask/metamask-extension/issues/2577), but we can enhance it all here.

","Why μRaiden is so important for community. uRaiden delivers IoT (Internet of Things) :)

The majority of people (87%) have not heard of the term ‘Internet of Things’.

1.ATMs are considered some of the first IoT objects, and went online as far back as 1974.

2.Back in 2008, there were already more objects connected to the Internet than people.

3.This year, we will have 4.9 billion connected things.

4.And some predict that by 2020, the number of Internet-connected things will reach or even exceed 50 billion.

5.In 2015, over 1.4 billion smart phones will be shipped and by 2020 we will have a staggering 6.1 billion smartphone users.

6.The IoT will connect many of the devices we have in our homes, from smart thermostats to smart fridges. Companies like Google GOOGL -0.53% and Samsung understand this. Google bought smart thermostat maker, Nest Labs, for $3.2 billion, and Samsung purchased connected home company SmartThings for $200 million.

7.By 2020, a quarter of a billion vehicles will be connected to the Internet, giving us completely new possibilities for in-vehicle services and automated driving.

8.In fact, we already have cars that can drive on their own - Google’s self-driving cars currently average about 10,000 autonomous miles per week.

9.  The global market for wearable devices has grown 223% in 2015, with Fitbit shipping 4.4 million devices and Apple AAPL -1.32% selling 3.6 million Apple Watches.

10. And yes, Internet-connected clothing is coming. Estimates predict that 10.2 million units of smart clothing will ship by 2020, compared to a meagre 140K units in 2013.

11. Today, the market for Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) tags, used for transmitting data to identify and track objects, is worth $11.1 billion. This is predicted to rise to $21.9 billion in 2020.

12. Machine-to-machine (M2M) connections will grow from 5 billion at the beginning of this year to 27 billion by 2024, with China taking a 21% share and the U.S. 20%.

13. GE believes that the “Industrial Internet” (their term for IoT) will add $10 to $15 trillion to global GDP in the next 20 years.

14. According to estimations by the McKinsey Global Institute, the IoT will have a total economic impact of up to $11 trillion by 2025.

15. Having a connected kitchen could save the food and beverage industry as much as 15% annually.

16. CISCO believes the IoT could generate $4.6 trillion over the next ten years for the public sector, and 
$14.4 trillion for the private sector.

The majority of people (87%) have not heard of the term ‘Internet of Things’.

1.ATMs are considered some of the first IoT objects, and went online as far back as 1974.

2.Back in 2008, there were already more objects connected to the Internet than people.

3.This year, we will have 4.9 billion connected things.

4.And some predict that by 2020, the number of Internet-connected things will reach or even exceed 50 billion.

5.In 2015, over 1.4 billion smart phones will be shipped and by 2020 we will have a staggering 6.1 billion smartphone users.

6.The IoT will connect many of the devices we have in our homes, from smart thermostats to smart fridges. Companies like Google GOOGL -0.53% and Samsung understand this. Google bought smart thermostat maker, Nest Labs, for $3.2 billion, and Samsung purchased connected home company SmartThings for $200 million.

7.By 2020, a quarter of a billion vehicles will be connected to the Internet, giving us completely new possibilities for in-vehicle services and automated driving.

8.In fact, we already have cars that can drive on their own - Google’s self-driving cars currently average about 10,000 autonomous miles per week.

9.  The global market for wearable devices has grown 223% in 2015, with Fitbit shipping 4.4 million devices and Apple AAPL -1.32% selling 3.6 million Apple Watches.

10. And yes, Internet-connected clothing is coming. Estimates predict that 10.2 million units of smart clothing will ship by 2020, compared to a meagre 140K units in 2013.

11. Today, the market for Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) tags, used for transmitting data to identify and track objects, is worth $11.1 billion. This is predicted to rise to $21.9 billion in 2020.

12. Machine-to-machine (M2M) connections will grow from 5 billion at the beginning of this year to 27 billion by 2024, with China taking a 21% share and the U.S. 20%.

13. GE believes that the “Industrial Internet” (their term for IoT) will add $10 to $15 trillion to global GDP in the next 20 years.

14. According to estimations by the McKinsey Global Institute, the IoT will have a total economic impact of up to $11 trillion by 2025.

15. Having a connected kitchen could save the food and beverage industry as much as 15% annually.

16. CISCO believes the IoT could generate $4.6 trillion over the next ten years for the public sector, and 
$14.4 trillion for the private sector.

For uRaiden you have to setup a payment channel with a service, e.g. you could setup a payment channel with a streaming service where you just pay them .00001 ETH per minute of streaming. uRaiden is unidirectional, so you can't receive payments from them. The Raiden Network makes it so you can setup a payment channel with a node, and you can send and receive payments from them, but the node having payment channels open with many other Raiden nodes would make it so you could do these instant, cheap, off-chain payments to anyone else that is somehow connected to the Raiden node you're connected to.",So uRaiden is only for situations where a user wants to pay a single entity multiple times?,1510814054.0

So, my questions are:

1- Can you have a smart contract that releases funds to 1000 wallets? or do I need 1000 smart contracts with one destination each?

3- Can you automate the initiation of a smart contract (since one one needs to send gas to start it)? An organization with limited funds in an emergency couldn't realistically sit down and send gas to these things one by one.

Yes. Typically the smart contract would keep an internal record of how much each account is owed, and allow them to claim those funds by calling it.

Pretty straightforward, depending on how you want it to work.

It actually reads like they did it this way to feel better about not going back out to a proper external audit...

Anyhow I imagine there were actually quite a lot people looking at this thing, and one thing I think we can learn from it is that if you make changes, you need somebody to go back through it with a fresh pair of eyes. Somebody who was doing audits - I think it was /u/Vessenes - was saying that they like to read the contract backwards to avoid jumping to misleading assumptions about control flow. Once you've read a contract once, you inevitably start focusing on particular aspects of it.

One common anti-pattern that I think we need to be particularly careful of is that the someone will send their contract out to an auditor, the auditor will make helpful suggestions about how the code can be better structured, and the project will follow those suggestions and the auditor will add a note saying, ""the developers tell us this is now fixed"". If you do that it really feels like you want to send it out to a fresh person to audit, which is obviously going to be expensive and potentially creates more suggestions, requiring more changes and more audits... It might make more sense to to separate out the roles of advising on how the code should be written and confirming that it looks secure. ",1510827338.0

I know it is easy to be smart in hindsight, but these are huge design errors, I can't comprehend how could this pass reviews in the architecture phase.","The most notable architectural failure arising from using the original wallet contract as a delegate contract (probably safer not to call it a library), was that it introduced an off chain trust relationship between Parity and any stub wallet owners.  The trust relationship was that Parity needed to perform an action to own the contract and then burn ownership so no one else could take control.

It was the failure of that trust relationship which has allowed the attack.

Regarding the choice of contract re-designed, i.e, taking a previously audited and secure contract and delegate-calling its code through a new stub contract, puts failure detection in the responsibility of integration testing rather than unit testing (which all would have passed securely).  Obviously it's going to be intuitively more acceptable to repurpose known secure code than rewrite the algos in the form of an actual stateless library.

Considering the purpose of deploying the contract in the delegate/stub pattern was to reduce on chain and state held bytecode and thereby deployment costs for users, it's worth being aware what the other patterns might have been....

1. Deploy individual wallets.

    Good - known secure

    Bad - unnecessary bytecode duplication in chain and state. normal deployment and usage costs.

2. Deploy central delegate wallet and stubs

    Good - lowest deployment costs. Lowest on chain and state bytecode bloat

    Bad - Slightly higher usage cost for delegate call. Introduces off chain trust relationship with Parity until delegate owner is burned.

3. Rewrite as stateless library and stub contracts.

    Good - Stateless so no off chain trust relation arises

    Bad - Hardcoding library links for every external function call ends up producing more bytecode than individual wallets would have. Bigger stub contract bytecode. Most expensive deployment and usage.  Least secure and most expensive code as it has to go through auditing again.

In short, the change in architecture was by far the most optimal in the sense of gas usage bytecode produced, using already secure code, however it opened up integration issues that were overlooked or forgotten about on both occasions.",1510855146.0

Yes, and there are a lot more hacks with dynamic web applications with server-side integration than you get with static HTML pages like Geocities. Ditto with feature phones that only have a dozen pre-packaged applets.

That doesn't mean that we should return to the static web or to feature phones.

Hardly. There are tons of Turing-complete embedded systems out there that have dangerous consequence of error should they fail but failures are actually pretty rare. You just need to approach these problems with the correct amount of due diligence and with the proper tools and procedures.

If all else fails, you can use a Turing-incomplete subset of Ethereum's capabilities and just replicate Bitcoin's limited scripting capabilities.

Dunno, though. You can keep the complexity off the chain, but that just moves it to the tooling, which is actually a bigger surface area than a contract. For instance, a lot of people have lost money to bad P2SH addresses that turn out to have done the hashing wrong, making them unspendable. That's less noticeable than a contract, because you can't look at all the instances of that and say, ""these ETH are stuck"", but the funds are just as gone for the unfortunate users.",1510827676.0

I agree, this lawyer foo-bar is a huge annoyance for moving on in/with the community. Here is a list of events I privately compiled to keep track of this issue. 

**July 19th, 2017**: Bug found in the multi-signature wallet code used by Parity (let's call it `A0` for reference). [Post-Mortem #1](https://paritytech.io/blog/the-multi-sig-hack-a-postmortem.html), [Here is the fixed code](https://github.com/paritytech/parity/blob/3c82a0d16225c19c7eff9056c0e78f0b796838a1/js-old/src/contracts/snippets/enhanced-wallet.sol#L219-L222), TL;DR `initWallet()` was `public` by default, because of that it was possible to just reinitialize basically any deployed multi-sig wallet. This caused an interesting discussion on Solidity by the way: [solidity#2608](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/2608).

**July 20th, 2017**: Hot-fix deployment of the multi-signature wallet in the form of a library contract (it's a librified version of `A0`, let's call it `B0`). [Transaction](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x348ec4b5a396c95b4a5524ab0ff61b5f6e434098cf6e5c1a6887bed2bc35625d). This was a time-critical move because there was the chance that people deploy new wallets with the bugged code. By updating the onchain registry to point to a new multi-sig wallet, we were immediately able to patch all previous and future versions at once without any user-interaction required.

**July 21st, 2017**: Fixed Multi-signature contract reviewed by seven developers (`A1`). [Pull Request](https://github.com/paritytech/contracts/pull/48). This one is used by the white hat group to deploy new, secure wallets for the users whose funds were rescued.

**August 2nd, 2017**: The library version of the multi-signature wallet deployed on July 20th is available for review (`B0`), _3esmit_ points out ""_the init function will be open in that contract_"". [Pull Request](https://github.com/paritytech/contracts/pull/74).

**August 15th, 2017**: A fix is committed to initialize the library with `0x00` owner (`B0` -> `B1`). [Commit](https://github.com/paritytech/contracts/pull/74/commits/02b9b7e1b532ae340ac2385d64e89d6e6d70c660). Note, that `B1` was never deployed, the on-chain library still had the vulnerable code of `B0`. Also, the on-chain `B0` was not initialized at this point to set an owner. Either of these actions would have prevented the hack.

**November 6th, 2017**: _devops199_ reports he killed the library by taking ownership and executing self-destruct. [parity#6995](https://github.com/paritytech/parity/issues/6995), [Transaction #1](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x05f71e1b2cb4f03e547739db15d080fd30c989eda04d37ce6264c5686e0722c9), [Transaction #2](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x47f7cff7a5e671884629c93b368cb18f58a993f4b19c2a53a8662e3f1482f690).

770,7d3w4s,comment,,"The most notable architectural failure arising from using the original wallet contract as a delegate contract (probably safer not to call it a library), was that it introduced an off chain trust relationship between Parity and any stub wallet owners.

It was the failure of that trust relationship which has allowed the attack.

Regarding the choice of contract re-designed, i.e, taking a previously audited and secure contract and delegate-calling its code through a new stub contract, puts failure detection in the responsibility of integration testing rather than unit testing (which all would have passed securely).  Obviously it's going to be intuitively more acceptable to repurpose known secure code than rewrite the algos in the form of an actual stateless library.

Dunno, though. You can keep the complexity off the chain, but that just moves it to the tooling, which is actually a bigger surface area than a contract. For instance, a lot of people have lost money to bad P2SH addresses that turn out to have done the hashing wrong, making them unspendable.

I agree, this lawyer foo-bar is a huge annoyance for moving on in/with the community. Here is a list of events I privately compiled to keep track of this issue. 

**July 19th, 2017**: Bug found in the multi-signature wallet code used by Parity (let's call it `A0` for reference). [Post-Mortem #1](https://paritytech.io/blog/the-multi-sig-hack-a-postmortem.html), [Here is the fixed code](https://github.com/paritytech/parity/blob/3c82a0d16225c19c7eff9056c0e78f0b796838a1/js-old/src/contracts/snippets/enhanced-wallet.sol#L219-L222), TL;DR `initWallet()` was `public` by default, because of that it was possible to just reinitialize basically any deployed multi-sig wallet. This caused an interesting discussion on Solidity by the way: [solidity#2608](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/2608).

**July 20th, 2017**: Hot-fix deployment of the multi-signature wallet in the form of a library contract (it's a librified version of `A0`, let's call it `B0`). [Transaction](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x348ec4b5a396c95b4a5524ab0ff61b5f6e434098cf6e5c1a6887bed2bc35625d). This was a time-critical move because there was the chance that people deploy new wallets with the bugged code. By updating the onchain registry to point to a new multi-sig wallet, we were immediately able to patch all previous and future versions at once without any user-interaction required.

**July 21st, 2017**: Fixed Multi-signature contract reviewed by seven developers (`A1`). [Pull Request](https://github.com/paritytech/contracts/pull/48). This one is used by the white hat group to deploy new, secure wallets for the users whose funds were rescued.

**August 2nd, 2017**: The library version of the multi-signature wallet deployed on July 20th is available for review (`B0`), _3esmit_ points out ""_the init function will be open in that contract_"". [Pull Request](https://github.com/paritytech/contracts/pull/74).

**August 15th, 2017**: A fix is committed to initialize the library with `0x00` owner (`B0` -> `B1`). [Commit](https://github.com/paritytech/contracts/pull/74/commits/02b9b7e1b532ae340ac2385d64e89d6e6d70c660). Note, that `B1` was never deployed, the on-chain library still had the vulnerable code of `B0`. Also, the on-chain `B0` was not initialized at this point to set an owner. Either of these actions would have prevented the hack.

**November 6th, 2017**: _devops199_ reports he killed the library by taking ownership and executing self-destruct. [parity#6995](https://github.com/paritytech/parity/issues/6995), [Transaction #1](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x05f71e1b2cb4f03e547739db15d080fd30c989eda04d37ce6264c5686e0722c9), [Transaction #2](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x47f7cff7a5e671884629c93b368cb18f58a993f4b19c2a53a8662e3f1482f690).

The EVM is single-threaded.","The method would be static meaning it would behave in such a way that it could not call member functions on other contracts (objects), even the contract's own parent contract, unless it was passed a reference to the contract as an argument. It would not have access to any state that was not also static. When every contract is visbile to every function in every other contract, that's a major flaw

I don't fault Solidity for not having AtomicBooleans and multithreading and all the various gadgets in the Java concurrency package. Java took decades to build all that. I fault the people selling Solidity as a production-ready solution. Solidity is in its infancy. So is the EVM. And it looks like backwards-incompatible changes are needed. Hopefully EVM 1.5 or eWASM makes breaking changes.

All of this boils down to saying that Solidity on EVM is not production-ready. Certainly not to store a quarter of a billion dollars. As much as I praise Java, I would not likely store a quarter of billion dollars in one piece of Java code accessible to the world either. But I would use it in production systems.

The bar is higher for Solidity than Java because of the decentralized and permissionless nature of the network and the unrecoverability of ether.

That's possible right now in Solidity, to the degree it's relevant. If you treat an address as a reference, that's precisely how it works.

> I don't fault Solidity for not having AtomicBooleans and multithreading and all the various gadgets in the Java concurrency package.

You don't need any of those, because the EVM is not concurrent. You can simply set a flag and check it to detect reentrancy - but as I mentioned earlier, that's a poor solution because it's inefficient and better solutions exist.

","I am glad that static calls were recently added to Solidity.

Considering that Solidity is yet to reach v1.0 it is surprising how much its use in production systems is being encouraged. Seems a moral hazard given that price is so tightly linked to adoption.

If you want to participate in the discussions there, please be respectful (as we all should be here).   Anybody trolling, making ad-hominem attacks, etc. will be booted from the channel.

This was my introduction for that new channel:

*So just to get us started here, the intention of this channel is to have a public forum in which we can discuss potential options with regard to recovering funds which are ""stuck"" within smart contracts on the mainnet, either through bugs in external tools, bugs in smart contracts which have been triggered accidentally or maliciously, or through plain human error (ie. sending ETH to address 0x0).*

*In many (all?) of these cases there is clear provenance and ownership of the funds. They just got into a bad spot where they cannot be retrieved with the existing protocol.*

*@vbuterin created [EIP156 - Reclaiming of ether in common classes of stuck accounts](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/156) a year ago, and it covers some, but not all of these cases.*

*It looks like @debris will be creating another EIP imminently, which would cover the Parity library deletion use-case, and offer a means of ""resurrecting"" selfdestruct-ed contracts.*

*And maybe others have further proposals to bring to the table.*

*Let's talk through the technical options here, creating EIPs as required for the various proposals.*

*I think that given that we aren't looking at any STOLEN funds here and there is no ticking timebomb that we have a fantastic opportunity here to have a constructive dialog about how to make technical improvements to our platform which make such black holes much harder to create in the future (Solidity and EVM tweaks), to provide some means to recover trapped funds - as long as we can do so in a way which is uniform and fair and not special case (not just ""if address=xxx then recover), and can also use this opportunity to improve our signaling and governance mechanisms.*

*For example ... Carbon Vote style coin vote mechanisms but with long lead times and blanket publicity, so nobody can say they didn't know or were not consulted. Preferably with some degree of obfuscation, so that people cannot identify who is voting which way. @wanderer got hammered for voting against the DAO fork very late, for example, because people worked out that the address corresponded to him. Cue accusations of whales trying to sway the ""election"". There is also probably some game theory in here which somebody better equipped than me could work through. DAO vote participation was very low because of the lost opportunity cost of tying up your votes early. Maybe a better way is lurking?*

*@SilentCicero, @koeppelmann, @karlfloersch, @vladzamfir, @virgil others, have ideas?*

*Ultimately, everyone will ""vote"" with the software they choose to run, but good signalling would certainly help.*

*The other area where we could maybe use this opportunity to improve governance would be in terms of forums which aren't such cesspits for gaming and sock-puppeting - like Reddit and Twitter.*

*Again, if we even had some simple chat forum, where coin stake was used as a filter (or flair), it would be hugely useful for signaling. Think Reddit karma, but with ETH stake.*",1510751046.0

Coinbase is building [Toshi](https://www.toshi.org) which is a browser for the Ethereum network looking to bring in the masses.

Brave browser (founded by Brendan Eich) has built and launched [BAT](https://basicattentiontoken.org), a blockchain based digital advertising platform.

I'd love to work directly with a client for once, I've been working through third parties almost exclusively for years, and it's not as rewarding as working directly with the creator of a text.  
  
I translate into Spanish and viceversa, although translating into English is a bit more expensive, but we can work something out.

I think this is the best way to start using Ether here in Argentina; Ether is hard to come by here, and rates are brutal.

","Well, yeah, this is the question. I hate and fear the prospect of Gab coming to Etherum. 

Bad for us. Bad for the world.

But they could fork Ethereum. They could write their own platform. They could move to another platform.

But what if they built on Ethereum? How many of our developers, supporters and fans would move to another platform, or force us to censor Nazi speech of it was being used to organize politically? And what if it escalated to murder? What if we saw something like lynchings of black Americans organized on an app that ran on Ethereum? What then?

This is why we fight the Nazis now. So we do not have to face that situation in the future.

Ah, the all new ""it was just a prank"" literary device made popular by YouTube pranksters.  Vinay basically attempted to create a hostile situation for Gab supporters in an attempt to drive them away from doing an ICO on Ethereum.  While he is free to do this he tried to make it sound like this was the official stance of the Ethereum Foundation.  Only when it started spiraling out of his control did he ever claim that his entire Twitter persona is a troll account.  That is totally disingenuous on his part.

0) I do not work for the Ethereum Foundation, and if I was speaking in an official territory, I would probably not have said things like ""we are all communists"" or ""fuck off you nazi motherfuckers, go build your own platforms.""

1) http://twitter.com/leashless *is* a troll account - it's me, and on this occasion, I was using it to troll the shit out of these racist motherfuckers. I take that shit seriously - I am the product of ""race mixing"" and in a Nazi ascendant world, I'd be in real danger. This problem is my problem.

2) I've said unwise things in the past when trolling nazis. The old game was agreeing with them that genetics do, indeed, determine intelligence and pointing out that white folks are about in the middle of the pack there, right behind the Nazi's ancient enemies, the Jews. This has been debated endlessly in academia, and is prime material for getting Nazis seriously hot under the collar -
 you cannot believe how much they hate it. It doesn't even have to be true.
 http://nymag.com/nymetro/news/culture/features/1478/

3) I *am* half white. My mother is white, I grew up in Scotland, and I didn't see any trace of racism in Europe - it was America where I saw it for the first time, and to this day, I've never seen what I'd call real racism pointed at me.

4) I have, however, dug my heels in for *years* in the ongoing struggle against violent authoritarianism, be it fascism, communism, or whatever. When I was a consultant on economic collapse and failed states, the rise of the new right in response to the ongoing global economic hardship was my number one concern - and here they are.

5) I'd have said Ethereum was populated by undead werewolves with bubonic plague if it reduced the odds that in six months the headlines would say ""Crypto-Nazis? What the alt-right's embrace of Ethereum tells us about the future of the internet"" or similar. The world is looking for sticks to beat us, as we become globally important, and as we all know *the platform is likely impossible to censor* so if we're going to hold the line against Nazis, it's going to be cultural actions, not technical measures, that do it.

6) Finally, I am not blind to the 150 million or so that communism (or at least things that called themselves communism) killed in the 20th century. I do not thing ""communist"" is a good thing - it's in the ""undead werewolf"" terrain. But I do believe that things like Basic Income may be the way forwards. Maybe. If it's done right. If it doesn't result in the total breakdown of society.

7) I don't know whether I've done the right thing or not. But it's done, and if anybody wants to go over there to the fascists who's feelings I've hurt to bring them back to the platform, all I can say is ""do as thou wilt."" It's your world as much as it is mine.

They will come to ""our"" platform, whether we like it or not. As we say in french ""l'ignorance est le plus grand des mépris"". A better strategy is probably the one of Vitalik: spend time supporting the good things and don't waste time with the rest.",1510773128.0

0) I do not work for the Ethereum Foundation, and if I was speaking in an official territory, I would probably not have said things like ""we are all communists"" or ""fuck off you nazi motherfuckers, go build your own platforms.""

1) http://twitter.com/leashless *is* a troll account - it's me, and on this occasion, I was using it to troll the shit out of these racist motherfuckers. I take that shit seriously - I am the product of ""race mixing"" and in a Nazi ascendant world, I'd be in real danger. This problem is my problem.

2) I've said unwise things in the past when trolling nazis. The old game was agreeing with them that genetics do, indeed, determine intelligence and pointing out that white folks are about in the middle of the pack there, right behind the Nazi's ancient enemies, the Jews. This has been debated endlessly in academia, and is prime material for getting Nazis seriously hot under the collar -
 you cannot believe how much they hate it. It doesn't even have to be true.
 http://nymag.com/nymetro/news/culture/features/1478/

3) I *am* half white. My mother is white, I grew up in Scotland, and I didn't see any trace of racism in Europe - it was America where I saw it for the first time, and to this day, I've never seen what I'd call real racism pointed at me.

4) I have, however, dug my heels in for *years* in the ongoing struggle against violent authoritarianism, be it fascism, communism, or whatever. When I was a consultant on economic collapse and failed states, the rise of the new right in response to the ongoing global economic hardship was my number one concern - and here they are.

5) I'd have said Ethereum was populated by undead werewolves with bubonic plague if it reduced the odds that in six months the headlines would say ""Crypto-Nazis? What the alt-right's embrace of Ethereum tells us about the future of the internet"" or similar. The world is looking for sticks to beat us, as we become globally important, and as we all know *the platform is likely impossible to censor* so if we're going to hold the line against Nazis, it's going to be cultural actions, not technical measures, that do it.

6) Finally, I am not blind to the 150 million or so that communism (or at least things that called themselves communism) killed in the 20th century. I do not thing ""communist"" is a good thing - it's in the ""undead werewolf"" terrain. But I do believe that things like Basic Income may be the way forwards. Maybe. If it's done right. If it doesn't result in the total breakdown of society.

7) I don't know whether I've done the right thing or not. But it's done, and if anybody wants to go over there to the fascists who's feelings I've hurt to bring them back to the platform, all I can say is ""do as thou wilt."" It's your world as much as it is mine.

**You're tone is still the same, and you are making this a ""if you're not racist you must agree with me and if you aren't with me you're racist"". I'm from Sweden and therefore probably know more about living in a multicultural society better than you'll ever understand. As you say this is your problem, so why did you speak on behalf of a whole community?**

**You know what? Nobody cares about this. You could be an eight dragon and that would not define you. Your actions do. I have no doubts about your intellectual capacity so, please, do a small exercise and analyze your actions from a third-party point of view. What do you see?**

**I have asked this before: When other platforms, based on current infrastructure, appeared what happened? Nothing. You're concerned with a certain fringe of the political spectrum, but what about the other fringes? What will happen if terrorist movements start building on Ethereum? Pedophiles? Criminal organizations? They won't be so vocal about their intentions, and won't be available to be trolled on Twitter. What is your stance on this?**

**After all this hours you still don't know if you've done the right thing or not? You spoke on behalf of an entire community; on behalf of a formal organization you don't belong to anymore and you still have doubts? And do you really think that your actions pushed anyone away? You didn't. You actually gave them more will power to make it happen. And that's what I don't understand: how did you not see it coming? How could you be so narrow minded to not have thought ahead before starting that war?**

I do not thing ""communist"" is a good thing - it's in the ""undead werewolf"" terrain. But I do believe that things like Basic Income may be the way forwards. Maybe. If it's done right. If it doesn't result in the total breakdown of society.

7) I don't know whether I've done the right thing or not. But it's done, and if anybody wants to go over there to the fascists who's feelings I've hurt to bring them back to the platform, all I can say is ""do as thou wilt."" It's your world as much as it is mine.

1275,7d0pbn,slc_comment,"Hello! Right, so, let me clarify a few things.

0) I do not work for the Ethereum Foundation, and if I was speaking in an official territory, I would probably not have said things like ""we are all communists"" or ""fuck off you nazi motherfuckers, go build your own platforms.""

1) http://twitter.com/leashless *is* a troll account - it's me, and on this occasion, I was using it to troll the shit out of these racist motherfuckers. I take that shit seriously - I am the product of ""race mixing"" and in a Nazi ascendant world, I'd be in real danger. This problem is my problem.

2) I've said unwise things in the past when trolling nazis. The old game was agreeing with them that genetics do, indeed, determine intelligence and pointing out that white folks are about in the middle of the pack there, right behind the Nazi's ancient enemies, the Jews. This has been debated endlessly in academia, and is prime material for getting Nazis seriously hot under the collar -
 you cannot believe how much they hate it. It doesn't even have to be true.
 http://nymag.com/nymetro/news/culture/features/1478/

3) I *am* half white. My mother is white, I grew up in Scotland, and I didn't see any trace of racism in Europe - it was America where I saw it for the first time, and to this day, I've never seen what I'd call real racism pointed at me.

4) I have, however, dug my heels in for *years* in the ongoing struggle against violent authoritarianism, be it fascism, communism, or whatever. When I was a consultant on economic collapse and failed states, the rise of the new right in response to the ongoing global economic hardship was my number one concern - and here they are.

5) I'd have said Ethereum was populated by undead werewolves with bubonic plague if it reduced the odds that in six months the headlines would say ""Crypto-Nazis? What the alt-right's embrace of Ethereum tells us about the future of the internet"" or similar. The world is looking for sticks to beat us, as we become globally important, and as we all know *the platform is likely impossible to censor* so if we're going to hold the line against Nazis, it's going to be cultural actions, not technical measures, that do it.

6) Finally, I am not blind to the 150 million or so that communism (or at least things that called themselves communism) killed in the 20th century.

1279,7d0pbn,comment,,"A couple of months ago I read an interview with a professor who is an expert in the 'antifa' group. He claimed that the reason antifa doesn't respect the right to free speech, and sometimes uses violence, was because fascism spreads like wildfire once it takes hold. It was a compelling argument that I had never heard before. The implications are chilling. They are basically saying that the rise of fascism is inevitable if left unchecked. That would also mean that speech would have to be censored, but what are the rules and who decides? I think this type of censorship would also lead to fascism or totalitarianism when the power to censor inevitably gets in the hands of the wrong people. I would rather have freedom of speech and the risks inherent with it than censorship and the veil it places over our eyes while nefarious forces plot their rise to power and control.",1510780759.0

Otherwise one could argue that you (i.e. whoever is taking the stance, e.g. community, foundation, miners, node operators) have acknowledged your responsibility of oversight to begin with. If push comes to shove, we should be able to *defend* the idea that Ethereum is a neutral group of protocols, not much different than what the Internet itself runs on.

Troll. ","Random question, how do you derive communist ideology from that of Ethereum, or any other cryptocurrency, for that matter? Speaking anecdotally, I've mostly seen right libertarians or anarcho-capitalists prevailing in cryptocurrency communities. Cryptocurrencies are inherently designed to propagate the free market of resources, and even have prospects of contributing to an increased privatization of the means of production through a circumvention of the state's control on the relevant resources. I've never really heard a socialist/communist argument for the existence of cryptocurrencies, but I'd love it if you could provide one. :) ",1510749810.0

","I haven't worked for the foundation in two years. My bio on twitter clearly states I'm the CEO of another company. It is perfectly clear.

I don't understand your comments about multiculturalism. What are you driving at? Did you notice the massively racist responses from the Alt Right people on the threat? Endless attacks about Indians worshipping dead technical support workers on the banks of the open sewer which is the Ganges and so on. ***No further evidence of their racism is required than their own words.***

I have, in the past, shown racists what they are saying by switching ""white"" for ""Indian"" or ""Jew"" and playing their messages back to them.

One of the reasons we lost e-gold (shut down around 2005, it was the precursor to BitCoin) is because they failed to keep those kinds of bad actors off their platform. And if we advertise as censorship resistant, we have to deal with the risk of empowering people who are doing bad things. But we ***can*** discourage Nazis and similar groups from using our platforms using a range of techniques. We can't censor, but that doesn't mean we can't fight with every other tool at our disposal.

So now resisting Nazis is ""narrow minded?"" That's just nuts.

As for this war: this war is ongoing. It started before WW2 with this particular ideology. You could argue that the fight for human freedom is always the same - today Nazis, yesterday the Monarchy, before that, superstition. I won't make that claim.

People or groups of people (such as Nazis) who openly support and promote racist ideas and calls to action shouldn't receive any sympathy, respect or guaranteed voice in modern civilized societies. Some things are just bad no matter how you try to spin it into a free speech movement- it's not, it's just pure hate and evil. Of course some will say hate and hate speech is a protected human right, but that doesn't mean normal peaceful, decent human beings have to tolerate it. Bad ideas will die when society as a whole collectively ignores the message and/or does not give the people who spread them a place to be heard. I don't see this as censorship, I see it as consensus. We evolve, we grow, or we die, end of story. The human race needs to move on and move forward, learn from our mistakes of our past and as we begin to build out blockchain technology I think it's in the best interest of all humanity to keep these protocols free and open, while at the same time build mechanisms within to disincentivize bad behavior, bad ideas, and do whatever we can to stop them from being regressive.",1510810307.0

As far as my opinion on Gab, (and safe spaces) - I don't even know what Gab is, and frankly I don't care.  But, arguing for or against Gab, and censorship, wasn't my original argument.  In other words your response is a strawman.  You've misrepresented my original argument to make it easy to attack.

What my maneuvering got us was this: https://dailystormer.hk/269362-2/ a nice clear position statement from the neonazis on Ethereum as something they despise. This is worth its weight in gold, and could literally buy us years of relative peace and quiet as they continue to labor under the misapprehension that I have created that we are all communists etc.

If we, as a largely uncensorable platform, wind up infested with nazis, the nightmare scenario is that we are faced with court orders in countries like Germany to censor, refuse, and wind up either with Ethereum banned in those countries, or worse, direct legal attacks on our staff. 

This is a significantly worse threat than the SEC going after the ICO crowd.

I'm just saying that if someone insults me, I don't insult back. Whatever responses you got, instead of keeping the high ground you put yourself at the same level, and all that while purportedly speaking on behalf of the foundation. 

>So now resisting Nazis is ""narrow minded?"" That's just nuts.

Please don't take what I wrote out of context. This is what I wrote:

>After all this hours you still don't know if you've done the right thing or not? You spoke on behalf of an entire community; on behalf of a formal organization you don't belong to anymore and you still have doubts? And do you really think that your actions pushed anyone away? You didn't. You actually gave them more will power to make it happen. And that's what I don't understand: how did you not see it coming? How could you be so narrow minded to not have thought ahead before starting that war?

What I perceive as narrow minded is the lack of strategical thinking on your side to understand that you would not accomplish a thing with your power trip, on the contrary, you probably just gave them more will power to go ahead with their plans.

Right or wrong? Maybe too soon to tell.

I object to the alt right because they are a rising power. They are dangerous, so I fight. I don't think any of the communist branches operating around the blockchain are remotely dangerous. Funny little side games, ineffective.

People or groups of people (such as Nazis) who openly support and promote racist ideas and calls to action shouldn't receive any sympathy, respect or guaranteed voice in modern civilized societies. Some things are just bad no matter how you try to spin it into a free speech movement- it's not, it's just pure hate and evil. Of course some will say hate and hate speech is a protected human right, but that doesn't mean normal peaceful, decent human beings have to tolerate it. Bad ideas will die when society as a whole collectively ignores the message and/or does not give the people who spread them a place to be heard. I don't see this as censorship, I see it as consensus. We evolve, we grow, or we die, end of story. The human race needs to move on and move forward, learn from our mistakes of our past and as we begin to build out blockchain technology I think it's in the best interest of all humanity to keep these protocols free and open, while at the same time build mechanisms within to disincentivize bad behavior, bad ideas, and do whatever we can to stop them from being regressive.",1510810307.0
